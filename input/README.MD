# Input Folder

This folder contains your cleaned and split datasets. After basic preprocessing and EDA has been done, we split the 'data/final_train.csv' into 2 datasets:

**1. `input/train.csv`:** Contains data to be used for model training only.
<br>

**2. `input/test.csv`:** Contains data to be used for evaluating model performance **AFTER TRAINING**. This is supposed to simulate unseen data that your model will come across.
