# Problem Statement 
Classification of penguins living on different islands
## Dataset

The dataset used is the Palmer Penguin dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/parulpandey/palmer-archipelago-antarctica-penguin-data) from (Kaggle). 

The 7 class labels are:
<br>

**1**. Species: penguin species (Chinstrap, Ad√©lie, or Gentoo)
<br>
**2**. Island: island name (Dream, Torgersen, or Biscoe) in the Palmer Archipelago (Antarctica)
<br>
**3**. culmen_length_mm: culmen length (mm)
<br>
**4**. culmen_depth_mm: culmen depth (mm)
<br>
**5**. flipper_length_mm: flipper length (mm)
<br>
**6**. body_mass_g: body mass (g)
<br>
**7**.Sex: penguin sex
<br>

## Model(s) Used

**K-Nearest-Neighbour**

The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, easy-to-implement supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems.The KNN algorithm assumes that similar things exist in close proximity.

**Logistic Regression**
<br>
Logistic Regression is a Machine Learning classification algorithm that is used to predict the probability of a categorical dependent variable. In logistic regression, the dependent variable is a binary variable that contains data coded as 1 (yes, success, etc.) or 0 (no, failure, etc.)

## Future Work
Implementing different models to achieve a higher accuracy score
